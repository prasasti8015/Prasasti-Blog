I am an Embedded Software Engineer at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions, Pvt. Ltd. 
Recently I have developed interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
That is the reason why I have created this blog to talk about this technology which I find really interesting.

So I will be coming up with posts once in a while.
Thank you for the support!
